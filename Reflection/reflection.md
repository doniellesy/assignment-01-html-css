# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

Semantic markup is essential in assigning meaning to the content of a webpage, which in turn, has many uses. From a technical standpoint, semantic elements help divide up and organize the code of a page, making it easier to navigate and understand for the coder, as well as others, when the page needs extra maintenance. It also helps the computer understand which information on the page is the most valuable content. A computer cannot distinguish the difference of relevance in the content of a page like a human can, therefore it relies on the HTML hierarchy of elements to organize the data. This also plays into the accessibility of a webpage for those with disabilities that prevent them from accessing information using a visual approach. If a computer can understand the components of the page, such as what content is considered the header or the main text, it can translate the information more effectively into a format, such as audio, that is more suitable for someone with accessibility needs. For example, words that are italicized are read and perceived with emphasis. A computer must be told through semantic markup that a particular phrase carries an emphasized meaning so it can select the appropriate audio function and interpret the text more accurately.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

The visual presentation of a webpage can greatly affect a viewer's experience when reading the content. The arrangement and format ideally should follow a flow of information that is both familiar and logical to the reader. For example, in traditional print media, abstracts and introductions are first, while sources and bibliographies are last. A page that follows these expectations makes it easier for the viewer to locate the information they are seeking. In contrast, a page with information that is placed in unconventional areas is harder to comprehend and forces the reader to adjust to the new format, an often frustrating and confusing process, rather than focusing on the content. The graphics of the page can also influence the reading process as certain designs can highlight or detract from the content. A page that has no images, small and dense text, and a boring color scheme doesn't grab the attention of the viewer, whereas complicated fonts and colors that are too bright and flashy come off as distracting and hard to look at. A webpage with a balance of tones, clear text, and enough visual stimuli can assist the reader's focus and absorption of the information.
