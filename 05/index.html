                Marilyn Monroe, was born on June 1, 1926 in Los Angeles, California, and came to be known as one of the most popular film stars in the Golden Age of Hollywood Cinema. Her iconography demonstrates the importance of stardom in the construction of Hollywood cinema and even extends to the present day.

                The era of American cinema roughly ranging from the late 1920s to the early 1960s was characterized by the establishment of the studio system and an almost restrictive contracting of entertainers. The presentation of these actors both on and off screen was calculated and purposeful as tabloid exposure and photography created optimum measures for the marketing of the films they appeared in. Celebrities were to be ordinary and approachable enough for the audience to relate to them, but also extraordinary and lavish enough to be coveted.
                A sex symbol to men and a glamourous icon to women, Marilyn epitomized the makings of the Hollywood star as her alluring appearance coupled with her charismatic charm satisfied the paradoxical nature of stardom. Her career was marked by her mastery of her image on the big screen and in the pages of the magazines.

              In addition, the image built out of her life events, from her struggles with sticking to a home as a child to her multiple romances with public figures, sparked controversy and debate throughout her time and beyond. Was she a glamourous, overtly sensual, empty-headed blonde? Was she a feminist ahead of her time, empowered by her sexuality and playing the Hollywood game? Or was she the tortured soul, born into the world without a home, used by the big studios, and gone too soon from a tragic drug overdose? To this day, the imagery of Marilyn and her life still circulate throughout pop culture and garner the same recognition and level of intrigue towards her persona.
